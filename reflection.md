I intially used ChatGPT to essentially give me a blank template by specifying a general look that I wanted. Of course this only got my vision partially right. I then looked at each page and considered what I wanted/needed to change. From this point on I no longer used ChatGpt to write code but instead used it to ask questions on how to do certain, smaller tasks. The most complicated issue I ran into was getting my image in the About Me page to sit in the the single cell table while having my text sit to the right of the image. Which led me down a path of figuring out how to essentially sub divide this table.
